## Explanation of Tech Utilized
- Frontend
  * React
  * CSS Grid
  * CSS Flexbox
- Testing
  * Jest

I kept this app pretty simple and did not bring in some of my favorite JS and CSS tools: Sass and React Bootstrap. They felt like overkill for this challenge.

I went with the React framework since this is the JavaScript framework I am most familiar with.

I utilized Grid and Flexbox for a modern CSS design layout.

This is a *MOBILE-FIRST* design (built using iPhone X screen size)
